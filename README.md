TodoApp (incomplete)

This challenge is incomplete, however, i would like to point out some accomplishments:

- Successful connection to a relational database (mysql)
- Connection from backend's server (localpost:8080) to frontend's server (localpost:3000)
- Showing items extracted from database at the webpage

I was not able to complete the task because i have not experience in frontend development. Also i was short of time due to my job. 

However, i am a fast learner person and i will be glad to start my work experience with you.

Thanks for your time.
